        <h1 class="thanks">Thanks for visiting Taylor's Plant Collective!</h1>
        <p>This is my personal project, born out of two passions: houseplants and learning how to code.</p>
        <p>What started as a few houseplants has now grown into a thriving collection, including favorites like Monstera, Philodendron, Calathea, and Pothos. Over the past year, my interest has blossomed into a full-blown hobby, and this year I’ve even started exploring the art of propagation.</p>
        <p>This website is a digital greenhouse of sorts: a space where I can share my journey, what I’m learning, and sharpen my web development skills along the way. Whether you're here to pick up a few plant care tips, follow along as I grow (in more ways than one), or just browse, I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
        <p>Let’s grow something great together—digitally and botanically.</p>
